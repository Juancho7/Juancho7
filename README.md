# Welcome, I’m Juan! 👋

## Juan Ordoñez

I’m a computer engineering student from Colombia, transitioning from a background in video editing into backend development and automation.

I’m currently in training, studying computer engineering and building personal projects to learn how to design and implement backend systems and automations.
My goal is to solve real‑world problems through software and automation while I keep growing my skills.

I’m also learning about organic virality with short‑form video and plan to go deeper into digital marketing, so I can better understand how software, automation and content work together to create real impact.
